### About Myself:

All my life I have a desire to continuously learn something new. After graduating from university and having worked in financial fields for several years, I decided that I was hungry for new knowledge in another industry. My choice fell on web development.

While studying this IT direction, I encountered many difficulties in understanding some topics, but at the same time I found something in this business that inspires me and brings me pleasure.

There is something wonderful about when you look for a bug in your code and try to make it workable and finally find a solution to the problem. I love to see the result of my work in the form of a beautiful and useful site for users. I like to see how the designer's layout turns into a real website in the vastness of the browser.

Now I am at the relative beginning of my path of becoming a developer and I think that I will succeed and I will fully know the advantages and opportunities of this profession.
